I have created an interactive tableau dashboard to analyze the data analyst positions in the United States. The dashboard allows the user to filter the visualizations by state, rating of the company and minimum salary offered. The users can simply click on the state initials at the top or change the values on the slider to get the visualization as per their requirements.

After downloading the data from the above mentioned source, I have first preprocessed the data in Python and then used the cleaned data for creating the dashboard in Tableau.
